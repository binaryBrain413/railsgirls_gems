This app will eventually (hopefully) include the following features:

Users (Sign in with Git/Google?)
Different Windows/Versions/Tabs/Blogs
Follow/Friend thing
Something that automatically runs code???
Location (to find those near you for Summer of Code and stuff)
Automatically alerts you of Rails Girls workshops
Learn Ruby tutorial
Achievements/cutesy badges

But for now (Rails Girls LA 2015), we'll just focus on the basics.
